## üõ†Ô∏è Features and Usage

**riemannian_stats** offers several key functionalities:

- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  Easily import and transform datasets using functions in `data_processing.py`.

- **Riemannian Analysis with UMAP:**  
  Perform advanced statistical methods with `riemannian_umap_analysis.py` for extracting principal components in Riemannian spaces.

- **Visualization:**  
  Generate insightful 2D and 3D plots, along with other visualizations using `visualization.py`.

- **Additional Utilities:**  
  Use helper functions available in `utilities.py` for various tasks.

## üìö Examples

The `examples/` directory contains two comprehensive examples demonstrating how to leverage **riemannian_stats** for Riemannian data analysis and visualization.

### Example 1: Data10D_250 Dataset

This example demonstrates the analysis of a high-dimensional dataset (`Data10D_250.csv`). The workflow includes:

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**  
  The dataset is loaded with `DataProcessing.load_data()`, using a comma as the separator and a dot for decimals. If a `cluster` column exists, clustering information is separated from the main analysis data, while retaining a copy for visualization.

- **UMAP and Riemannian Analysis:**  
  An instance of `RiemannianUMAPAnalysis` is created with a neighbor count calculated as the dataset length divided by 5. The analysis includes:
  - UMAP graph similarities.
  - Computation of the rho matrix.
  - Calculation of Riemannian vector differences.
  - Generation of the UMAP distance matrix.
  - Derivation of Riemannian covariance and correlation matrices.
  - Extraction of principal components from the correlation matrix.
  - Calculation of explained inertia using the first two principal components.

- **Visualization:**  
  Depending on the presence of clustering data, the example produces:
  - A **2D scatter plot** with clusters.
  - A **Principal plane plot** showcasing principal components.
  - A **3D scatter plot** with clusters.
  - A **Correlation circle plot** to display correlations between original variables and principal components.

*For full details, see [example1.py](./examples/example1.py)*

### Example 2: Iris Dataset

Using the classic Iris dataset (`iris.csv`), this example illustrates the package's capabilities on a well-known, lower-dimensional dataset:

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**  
  The Iris dataset is imported using `DataProcessing.load_data()`, with a semicolon as the separator and a dot as the decimal. It checks for a `tipo` column to extract clustering information, which is then separated from the analysis data.

- **UMAP and Riemannian Analysis:**  
  An instance of `RiemannianUMAPAnalysis` is initialized with the dataset and a neighbor count determined as the data length divided by 3. The analysis process includes:
  - Calculation of UMAP graph similarities.
  - Derivation of the rho matrix.
  - Computation of Riemannian vector differences.
  - Generation of the UMAP distance matrix.
  - Calculation of Riemannian covariance and correlation matrices.
  - Extraction of principal components.
  - Determination of explained inertia (as a percentage) using the first two components.
  - Evaluation of correlations between the original variables and principal components.

- **Visualization:**  
  When clustering data is available, the example generates:
  - A **2D scatter plot** with clusters (using dimensions such as `s.largo` and `s.ancho`).
  - A **Principal plane plot** with clusters.
  - A **3D scatter plot** with clusters (adding a third dimension with `p.largo`).
  - A **Correlation circle plot** that is produced in all cases.

*For full details, see [example2.py](./examples/example2.py)*

## üîç Testing

The package includes a suite of unit tests located in the `tests/` directory. To run the tests, ensure [pytest](https://pytest.org/) is installed (it's included in the package configuration) and run:

```bash
pytest
```

This ensures that all functions and modules perform as expected throughout development and maintenance.
